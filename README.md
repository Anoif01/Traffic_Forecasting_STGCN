# ðŸš¦ Dynamic 3D Traffic Flow Visualization and Advanced Forecasting ðŸš€

This repository showcases a project focused on visualizing traffic flow in Los Angeles using 3D maps and improving traffic forecasting accuracy through advanced deep learning models.

## ðŸ”¥ Dynamic 3D Traffic Flow Visualization

Leveraging the **METR-LA dataset**â€”which records traffic flow at 207 locations in Los Angeles every five minutes for three monthsâ€”this project creates dynamic 3D visualizations. Using **Pydeck** and tools like **Selenium** and **Imageio**, we transform static data into vivid videos, overcoming limitations in built-in animation and export features.

**Key Features:**
- **Dynamic 3D Visualization**: Integrates Pydeckâ€™s Heatmap, Scatter, Grid, and Text layers to present a comprehensive view of traffic flow.
- **Visualization Tools**: Developed in Kaggle, this project highlights Pydeckâ€™s data visualization capabilities.

## ðŸš¦ Advanced Traffic Forecasting with Deep Learning

Building on the Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (STGCN) model, this project explores the use of alternative architectures to enhance traffic forecasting accuracy. We experimented with:

- (Bi)GRU
- (Bi)LSTM
- Attention-based (Bi)LSTM
- Attention-based (Bi)GRU
- Multi-Head Attention (MHA)
- MAMBA

**Key Results:**
- **Model Improvement**: Replacing the TCN with GRU in STGCN significantly reduced the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) from 3.33 to 3.26.
- **Visualization Tools**: Pydeck, Plotly, and Mapbox were used to visualize model predictions against actual data.
